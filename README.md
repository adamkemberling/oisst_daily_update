# About:

This repo was created to isolate the data acquisition steps that underpin any of the SST reporting 
or SST resources made available to the RES team.

The goal is to isolate these steps that do not change, and automate them using github actions. Hopefully ensuring that any SST resources we use in day-to-day science is up-to-date. If nothing else, this was a foray into automation using github actions, and unit testing to flag/track errors that might impact the original www.github.com/gulfofmaine/oisst_mainstays repo workflow.

**Inspiration:**
Much of the code framework for setting up this repository follows this article by [uncharted data](https://uncharteddata.netlify.app/posts/2022-10-07-automating-workflows-with-github-actions/).
